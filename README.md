# Kalani's Portfolio Website

About This Project
This is my personal cybersecurity and tech portfolio. It highlights my projects, certifications, and experiences as I grow in the fields of cybersecurity, web development, and information technology. Designed with a clean and modern aesthetic, fully responsive across all devices. 

The goal of this website is to serve as a central hub for my professional presence; a space to share my work, connect with others, and demonstrate both technical skill and creative design. 

Learning cybersecurity during the day, and website application development at night. 
This project was an exciting, challenging, and thrilling project to build and work on, creating a joined 
project of website design, development, and cybersecurity together into one mission. 

I will update this portfolio as I progress in my journey through college, gaining tech certifications, 
or the self studying I do in software project development. <3
